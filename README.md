# Operating-System-CSCE611
In this coures project, we implemented dynamic memory allocation, and translated the physical address into the virtual address by page table. We also handled a multiple threads condition by both FIFO and Round-Robin algorithms. And at the end, for the final project, Weimplemented a simple file system which supports sequential access to a file. The design of the file system is shown in this picture.
