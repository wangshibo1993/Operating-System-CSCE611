# Operating-System-CSCE611
In this course project, we implemented dynamic memory allocation and translated the physical address into the virtual address by a page table. We also handled a multiple threads condition by both FIFO and Round-Robin algorithms. And at the end, for the final project, We implemented a simple file system which supports sequential access to a file. You can find all the details in the report of each machine problem.
